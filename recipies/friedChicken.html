    <p>
      This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried
      chicken I have ever tasted! It has been a picnic favorite in my family for
      years and tastes equally good served hot or cold.

      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>

      <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 3 cups
        flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning
        together in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and
        1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if
        batter is too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour
        mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the
        seasoned flour mixture once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until
        crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the mixture into the pan, wait until the sides are brown, and
        carefully flip the eggplant.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>ENJOY!</strong>
